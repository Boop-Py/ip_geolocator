# ip_geolocator

Uses the information taken from a router to look at IP addresses.
The script runs the IP address through an API (IP API) to retrieve geo information in a JSON format. 
An output in a CSV is then created showing the country against the IP address.

##TODO 
Automate extracting from the router- look into ways of doing this.
Plot points on a map for a visual representation.
Show number of times IP address has been seen.
